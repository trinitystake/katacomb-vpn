# Katacomb VPN 1.5.1

A desktop client for the Sentinel decentralized VPN network. Pick a node, pay for a
session on-chain, and tunnel through WireGuard, AmneziaWG, OpenVPN, V2Ray, XRAY or
Hysteria2.

A maintenance release. The AppImage can now install its privileged helper, which had
silently never worked, and the files the app ships are laid out by what they are. If you
upgrade the .deb while the app is open, quit it from the tray and relaunch before
connecting.

## Highlights

- The AppImage's helper install works. Clicking Install on the first-run "VPN Helper Setup" dialog authenticated you and then did nothing, on every launch, because root cannot read a running AppImage's mount. The files are now staged where root can read them first. Until this fix an AppImage-only user could never use WireGuard, AmneziaWG, OpenVPN or a full tunnel; only local-proxy mode worked.
- Quit and relaunch the app after upgrading the .deb. The bundled binaries moved, and a 1.5.0 app left running in the tray through the upgrade keeps looking in the old place: an AmneziaWG connect then reports that its binaries are missing, and the other protocols may fall back to a system copy if you have one installed. The freshly launched app is unaffected.
- The shipped files are laid out by role: the vendored binaries beside their licence texts, the helper, polkit policy and systemd unit that the package installs onto the system, and the deb maintainer scripts, which are no longer shipped inside the package.

## Fixes in 1.5.1

- Reorganise resources/linux/ by role and fix the AppImage helper install

## Known limitations

- **A chain has a hard life of about two hours.** Measured on mainnet: exit hops report
  no usage to the chain, so the exit's idle deadline is pinned at purchase and never
  moves, even while the entry still has quota. This is node-side behaviour, not a client
  bug, but it is yours to plan around.
- Chains can only be built from V2Ray and XRAY nodes. The other protocols have no
  equivalent of the relay mechanism a chain needs.
- Expect roughly 2 to 3 MB/s and a large latency increase on a chain. Chains are for
  privacy, not speed.
- Local-proxy mode tunnels only the apps you point at its SOCKS address. Everything else
  leaks, by design, and the kill switch does not apply.
- The TLS and Reality wrapping does not authenticate the node. There is nothing on chain
  to verify a node's certificate against, so an attacker on your local network can answer
  a handshake in a node's place.

## Platform support

**Linux x86_64 only.** Tested on Debian 11+, Ubuntu 20.04+, and derivatives (Mint,
Pop!\_OS, Zorin).

## Installation

**Recommended: .deb**

```bash
sudo apt install ./katacomb-vpn_1.5.1_amd64.deb
```

Installs a root daemon, so connect and disconnect never prompt for a password. It needs
one log out and log back in after the first install before that takes effect.

**Alternative: AppImage**

```bash
chmod +x katacomb-vpn-1.5.1.AppImage
./katacomb-vpn-1.5.1.AppImage
```

No install needed. Every privileged operation prompts for a password instead.

## Verifying your download

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS
```

you have not already:

```

## Important

- **Connecting spends real funds.** Sessions are blockchain transactions priced in
  `udvpn`, and a failed connection is refunded automatically, but an expired one is not.
- **AppImage on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04** needs `libfuse2`, or the
  `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` workaround. See the README.
- **AppImage on Ubuntu 24.04+** runs with the Chromium sandbox disabled. An AppImage can
  install neither an AppArmor profile nor a SUID sandbox helper, so prefer the .deb there.

## Security model

Node operators are treated as adversaries. Everything a node sends is validated before it
reaches a privileged operation, because a VPN config can otherwise run shell commands as
root. See [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/trinitystake/katacomb-vpn/blob/main/CLAUDE.md)
for the full threat model and architecture.
