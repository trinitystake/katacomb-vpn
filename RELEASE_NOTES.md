# Katacomb VPN 1.5.2

A desktop client for the Sentinel decentralized VPN network. Pick a node, pay for a
session on-chain, and tunnel through WireGuard, AmneziaWG, OpenVPN, V2Ray, XRAY or
Hysteria2.

A small fix release. The IP display no longer reports "unreachable" through a node on
the other side of the world, and the same fix covers the app's own chain and
lookup calls made through a distant tunnel.

## Highlights

- The IP display works through far-away nodes. Connected through a node with a long
  round trip, the app's own IP lookup gave up before the reply could arrive, so the
  dashboard showed "IP: unreachable" while browsing through the same tunnel worked. The
  app now allows 2 seconds per connection attempt, which is enough for a two-hop chain
  across the world. Any request the app makes to a host that has both IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses, including most RPC endpoints, benefits from the same change.

## Fixes in 1.5.2

- Correct CLAUDE.md on the renderer poll intervals and the shipped systemd unit
- Give Node's per-address connection attempt 2 s instead of its default

## Known limitations

- **A chain has a hard life of about two hours.** Measured on mainnet: exit hops report
  no usage to the chain, so the exit's idle deadline is pinned at purchase and never
  moves, even while the entry still has quota. This is node-side behaviour, not a client
  bug, but it is yours to plan around.
- Chains can only be built from V2Ray and XRAY nodes. The other protocols have no
  equivalent of the relay mechanism a chain needs.
- Expect roughly 2 to 3 MB/s and a large latency increase on a chain. Chains are for
  privacy, not speed.
- Local-proxy mode tunnels only the apps you point at its SOCKS address. Everything else
  leaks, by design, and the kill switch does not apply.
- The TLS and Reality wrapping does not authenticate the node. There is nothing on chain
  to verify a node's certificate against, so an attacker on your local network can answer
  a handshake in a node's place.

## Platform support

**Linux x86_64 only.** Tested on Debian 11+, Ubuntu 20.04+, and derivatives (Mint,
Pop!\_OS, Zorin).

## Installation

**Recommended: .deb**

```bash
sudo apt install ./katacomb-vpn_1.5.2_amd64.deb
```

Installs a root daemon, so connect and disconnect never prompt for a password. It needs
one log out and log back in after the first install before that takes effect.

**Alternative: AppImage**

```bash
chmod +x katacomb-vpn-1.5.2.AppImage
./katacomb-vpn-1.5.2.AppImage
```

No install needed. Every privileged operation prompts for a password instead.

## Verifying your download

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS
```

you have not already:

```

## Important

- **Connecting spends real funds.** Sessions are blockchain transactions priced in
  `udvpn`, and a failed connection is refunded automatically, but an expired one is not.
- **AppImage on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04** needs `libfuse2`, or the
  `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` workaround. See the README.
- **AppImage on Ubuntu 24.04+** runs with the Chromium sandbox disabled. An AppImage can
  install neither an AppArmor profile nor a SUID sandbox helper, so prefer the .deb there.

## Security model

Node operators are treated as adversaries. Everything a node sends is validated before it
reaches a privileged operation, because a VPN config can otherwise run shell commands as
root. See [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/trinitystake/katacomb-vpn/blob/main/CLAUDE.md)
for the full threat model and architecture.
