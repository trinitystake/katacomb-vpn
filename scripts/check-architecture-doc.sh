# Re-checks docs/architecture/katacomb-vpn.architecture.json against the code it
# claims to describe, and runs as part of `npm test`.
#
# The JSON is the typed source for the runtime architecture map (see
# docs/architecture/README.md). Its components carry `sources` pins into real
# files, and Archify's validator reads those blobs AT A COMMIT — so re-pinning to
# HEAD and validating turns "a module this diagram names was renamed, moved or
# deleted" into a red test instead of a diagram that quietly stops being true.
# That is the whole point: a stale architecture picture is worse than none.
#
# What it cannot catch: a module that changed MEANING without changing its path,
# a new module nobody drew, or an edge that no longer exists. Those are on the
# author, which is why CLAUDE.md carries the rule as well.
#
# SKIPS, never fails, when Archify is not installed. It is an agent skill living
# in the user's home (`npx skills add tt-a1i/archify -g`), not a repo dependency,
# so CI and a fresh clone must stay green without it.
#
# The pinned revision in the committed JSON is left alone: it records the commit
# the diagram was last verified against. This check always validates at HEAD,
# using a temporary copy.

check-architecture-doc: FAILED at HEAD ($HEAD_REV).

  docs/architecture/katacomb-vpn.architecture.json no longer describes this tree.
  A source pin usually means a file moved; a layout error means the JSON was
  edited by hand without re-running the validator.

  Fix the JSON, then re-render and re-pin:

    node ~/.claude/skills/archify/bin/archify.mjs deliver architecture \\
      docs/architecture/katacomb-vpn.architecture.json \\
      docs/architecture/katacomb-vpn-architecture.html \\
